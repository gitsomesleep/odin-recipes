        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This banana bread recipe is one of my favorites. It is not too heavy or overly wet. It isn't ridiculously sweet like so many other recipes I've tried either.</p>
        <p>The instructions are straightforward and uncomplicated, too! I don't like complex recipes myself, but this was something my 9 year old could follow on his own.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingred">
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        
            <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
        
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
        
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        
            <li>2 ⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>

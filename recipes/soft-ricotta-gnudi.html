        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe I'd like to try. And by "try", I mean taste. Consume. Inhale... I don't pretend to be a skilled chef or anything.</p>
        <p>This is supposed to be authentic Italian cooking. It doesn't have "four-cheese" in the recipe title. So that's a solid start. Plus ricotta and <em>sage</em> - *drooling sounds*!</p>
        <p>(Recipe by Silvana Nava. Source <a href="https://www.recipesfromitaly.com/ricotta-gnudi/">HERE</a> on Recipes from Italy.)</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Gnudi</h3>
        <ul class="ingred">
            <li>300 g (~10 oz) ricotta cheese</li>
        
            <li>70 g (½ cup) all purpose flour</li>
        
            <li>80 g (¾ cup) grated Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
        
            <li>a pinch of grated nutmeg</li>
        
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
        
            <li>ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Seasoning</h3>
        <ul class="ingred">
            <li>90 g (~¼ stick) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>5-6 sage leaves</li>
            <li>Grated Parmigiano Reggiano, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Making the Dough</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>To prepare ricotta gnudi, start by draining the ricotta. Place it in a fine-mesh colander over a bowl and let any excess whey drain out. If the ricotta is already firm and dry, you can skip this step. However, if it’s too moist, press it lightly with a spoon or let it sit for about 15–30 minutes to remove extra liquid. This step is essential for achieving the right dough consistency.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In a large mixing bowl, add the ricotta and about ¼ cup (50 g) of the flour (reserving the rest for later).</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Next, add Parmigiano Reggiano. Season with a pinch of salt, ground black pepper, and a touch of grated nutmeg. Mix everything together with a spoon or spatula until you get a smooth, soft dough.</p></li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <h3>Shaping the Ricotta Gnudi</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Lightly flour your hands and start shaping the gnudi. Take small portions of the dough and make them into balls about 1.5 to 2 inches (4–5 cm) in diameter. With these quantities, you should get 12 to 15 gnudi.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Arrange the ricotta balls on a tray lined with parchment paper or a lightly floured surface. Then, place the tray in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. This resting time helps the gnudi firm up, making them easier to handle and preventing them from breaking apart while cooking.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Once the gnudi have rested, sprinkle a clean surface (such as a pastry board or countertop) with the remaining flour. Roll each gnudo gently in the flour until it is evenly coated. This extra flour helps seal the outside and keeps them from sticking together when boiling.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <h3>Cooking the Ricotta Gnudi</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Carefully drop the gnudi into the water a few at a time, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Let them cook for a few minutes, until they rise to the surface—this means they are done. Be gentle when stirring to avoid breaking them.</p>
                    <p>While the ricotta gnudi are cooking, melt the butter in a small pan over low heat. Add the sage leaves and let them infuse the butter for a few minutes until fragrant. The sage should become slightly crispy but not burnt.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Once the gnudi float to the surface, use a slotted spoon to carefully lift them out of the water and transfer them directly to serving plates.</p></li>
                <li><p>Drizzle the sage-infused butter over them and sprinkle generously with grated Parmigiano Reggiano. Serve immediately while hot and enjoy their soft, delicate texture!</p></li>
            </ol>
